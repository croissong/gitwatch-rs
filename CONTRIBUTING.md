Thanks for contributing!

## Development

There's a [nix devshell](/pkg/nix/devshell.nix) available, and a [justfile](justfile) for common commands - run `just` to see what's available.

The [example](example/) directory has a sample repo you can use to get started. See its readme for details. 

## Testing

Run `just test` to run all unit & integration tests.



That's it! Feel free to open an issue if you have questions.
